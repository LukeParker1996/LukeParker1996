### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
The files name is  SQLProductsByPrice.
The purpise of this file is to show  all the products available listed by price in descending order.

Second file is named SQLProductGT25.
The purpose of this file is to show the products that have a price higher than 25. It then sorts it by price in ascending order.

File "MyHTML" is my very first HTML code ever created. 

The network design file is a diagram of network topology. This infrastructure topology consists of 3 computers on one side that send information into a switch. The switch then can send packets to the router. This format is mirrored on the opposite side. The router can then send those packets to the printer. I chose the infrasctructure model because it is a common one used in businesses.
File MyPage.html is my first attempt at creating my own webpage within notebook. MyPage.png is a picture of said webpage once run.
